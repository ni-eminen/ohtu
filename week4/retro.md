It seems the  two topics that were encouraged to be read are quite similar. They both use a categorization of the good, the bad and the ugly, and some more. I personally like start, stop, continue, more of, less of wheel more. It is very descriptive in its nature and can likely be performed quite fast. It utilizes a pie chart to group the aforementioned categories and then prompts the attendees to suggest what they think that particular sprint presented in each category. I think the actionable nature of the categories makes the ideas easy to implement for the next sprint. Additionally the mention of ‘use silence – wait for comments’ fits the awkward Finnish culture well. It also presented a variation for a larger group, in which multidisciplinary participants first think of the questions from different kinds of standpoints.
