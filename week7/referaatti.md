# Lean thinking reference

### What is lean thinking

Lean was first coined by Toyota and it became popular after Toyota proved to be a resilient company that is getting better overtime. This has been shown numerous times by Toyota passing milestones such as being the largest vehicle company by sales and being consistently rated as top quality by J.D. Power. Nowadays lean might be referenced to as the "Toyota Way".

Lean aims to improve the productivity and efficiency of companies by removing operations that do not directly add value for the customer. It is especially favoured in startups looking to bootstrap their operations.


The Lean model is neatly summarized in the Lean-thinking house graphic, which introduces the following building blocks of Lean:
- Foundation
- Respect for People
- Continuous improvement
- Goal

In the heart of the house there lies
- Product development and
- the 14 principles of Lean

The goal of Lean is ultimately to deliver great value in an efficient, fast, and sustainable fashion. Continuous improvement is an integral part of the way that employees are mentored towards the goal. For it, there is a Japanese term called "Kaizen", which is often mistaken as a synonym for Continous improvement, but in reality Kaizen represents many more aspects of Continous improvement that includes the personal mindset of the employee. In Lean philosophy, all the employees must embody the lean thinking principles. Managers teach this to their employees and have typically grown into their role through being an employee first.

Lean thinking represents much more than what I can cover in .25 pages, but this has been the gist of Lean as interpreted from the Lean primer by Craig Larman and Bas Vodde.
